/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

/*
Coding Challenge #2 
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and 
improve it. 
Your tasks: 
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message 
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!" 
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's 
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" 
Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰ 
 
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
